# WIP - clone of airbnb

This is the final project of our team during the internship in Vineti Armenia. The app is a clone of Airbnb booking app. You can register either as a regular user to book a property or as a host user to give for rent.

Written in Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, testings were done via Cyrpess and Selenium.

# To run the app:
```sh
rails s
```
