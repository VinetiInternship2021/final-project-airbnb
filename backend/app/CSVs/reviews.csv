Very nice place,"Great place with a nice outside area. Komang was very helpful with everything. Great location close to the shops."
Excellent service and cuisine,"we really enjoy and happy to stay in baahi villa, the location is near from the attraction places that we want. The kitchen stuff is complete, you can cook whatever you want. During our stay, it was heavy rain in the afternood but we still can enjoy Bali inside the villa. Thank you Bu Komang, she is a great host, very nice, initiative and helpful. We will be back in another time."
Definitely will come back soon!,"Nice location, easy to find and strategic, the host bu komang is very nice, helpfull and communicative, need a little bit maintanance, but overall the facilities (kitchen, bed, living area,pool and bathroom) is awesome for us to stay enjoying our babymoon.. the pool little bit too deep, about 150cm if you wanna swim with your children.. i’ll comeback here for sure :)"
"Such a great pleasure, worth to try","Villa was so nice and comfortable, so clean, and there are lots of food stall nearby if you don’t mind to take a walk, and mrs. Komang herself is sooo kind, so thoughtful, thank you mrs. Komang, will definitely comeback again ❤️"
It was a pleasure to stay here,"Me and my wife would love to comeback. Mrs Komang is really nice and easy to contact. Amazing experience staying at her place. Truely recommended. Thanks for the hospitality mrs"
Everything was perfect. I recommend,"Bu Komang's place is very convenient to stay, whether its a staycation or a family trip. The villa is located in Legian, which makes it easier to commute. It is also clean and spacious."
